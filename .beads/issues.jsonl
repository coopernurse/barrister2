It builds cross-platform binaries and uploads them to GitHub Releases.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)\n- Go 1.21+ (language)\n- Node.js 20 (web UI build)\n- softprops/action-gh-release@v2 (release management)\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n1. **Matrix build strategy**: Single workflow with matrix eliminates code duplication and ensures consistent build steps across all platforms.\n\n2. **Draft release on tag push**: Creates a draft release so maintainers can review before publishing. Prevents accidental releases.\n\n3. **SHA256 checksums file**: `barrister_checksums.txt` allows users to verify binary integrity after download.\n\n4. **Separate build and assemble jobs**: Build runs in parallel for all platforms; assemble waits for all to complete. This is more efficient than sequential builds.\n\n## Data Flow\n\n```\ngit push v1.0.0\n    ↓\nGitHub Actions triggered\n    ↓\nMatrix job spawns 5 parallel builds\n    ↓\nEach build: checkout → setup Go/Node → build web UI → compile binary → upload artifact\n    ↓\nassemble job downloads all artifacts\n    ↓\nCompute SHA256 checksums\n    ↓\nsoftprops/action-gh-release creates draft release with artifacts\n    ↓\nMaintainer publishes release\n    ↓\nUsers download from /releases/latest/download/\n```","acceptance_criteria":"Workflow file created at .github/workflows/build-binaries.yml; Triggers on v* tags and release published; Builds 5 platform targets; Computes and uploads SHA256 checksums; Creates draft release with artifacts","notes":"Source: docs/plans/2026-01-14-binary-releases-design.md","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","owner":"claude@anthropic.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:59:52.186307796Z","created_by":"Claude Sonnet","updated_at":"2026-01-14T17:07:24.870612419Z","closed_at":"2026-01-14T17:07:24.870612419Z","close_reason":"Implemented and verified: GitHub Actions workflow created at .github/workflows/build-binaries.yml with 5 platform builds, SHA256 checksums, and draft release creation","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"workspace-6ip.1","depends_on_id":"workspace-6ip","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:59:52.20046927Z","created_by":"Claude Sonnet"}]}
