## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Download Pre-built Binary

chmod +x barrister
mv barrister /usr/local/bin/
```

### Method 2: Docker

Run Barrister via Docker:

## Troubleshooting

> **Need Help?** If you encounter issues not covered here, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/coopernurse/barrister2/issues).

### Command not found

If you get `barrister: command not found`:

1. Check your PATH: `echo $PATH`
2. Add Go bin to PATH (if using Go install):
   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### Wrong Go version

Barrister requires Go 1.21 or later. Check your version:

```bash
go version
```

### Permission denied

> **Common Issue**: This usually happens when downloading pre-built binaries. Make sure to set executable permissions.

If you get permission errors, make the binary executable:

```bash
chmod +x barrister
```

### macOS "developer cannot be verified"

On macOS, downloaded binaries may be blocked by Gatekeeper with the error "developer cannot be verified". To allow the binary to run:

```bash
xattr -cr /path/to/barrister-darwin-amd64
# Or right-click the file and select "Open Anyway" in System Settings
```
